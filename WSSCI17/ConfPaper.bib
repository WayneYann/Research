@article{Shampine1985,
abstract = {Many problems have been proposed for the testing and evaluation of mathematical software for the solution of the initial value problem for a system of ordinary differential equations. The stiffness of a given problem is of great significance for testing, but the concept is at best somewhat vague and the few quantitative measures of stiffness being used are of limited value. A relatively precise and quantitative way is proposed to answer the questions: How does the stiffness vary in the course of the integration of a given problem? Is a given problem A stiffer than a given problem B, and if so, by how much? ?? 1985.},

@article{Brugnano2011,
abstract = {The notion of stiffness, which originated in several applications of a different nature, has dominated the activities related to the numerical treatment of differential problems for the last fifty years. Contrary to what usually happens in Mathematics, its definition has been, for a long time, not formally precise (actually, there are too many of them). Again, the needs of applications, especially those arising in the construction of robust and general purpose codes, require nowadays a formally precise definition. In this paper, we review the evolution of such a notion and we also provide a precise definition which encompasses all the previous ones. {\textcopyright} 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},
